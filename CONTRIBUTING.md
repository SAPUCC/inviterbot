# Contributing to this project
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Github-Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/), so all 
code changes happen through pull requests.
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPLv3 software license
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its GPLv3 license.

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.
Bug reports that contain confidential information from the UCC context should not be posted on Github. Instead, create an issue in the internal Gitlab. Please also create a dummy-issue here on Github containing the respective link.

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
These are two good bug report examples:
- <https://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626>
- <https://www.openradar.me/11905408>

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
